## Requirements
- Spotify client needs to run on the machine hosting the server
- Only compatible with MacOS X 10.10 or later
- [NodeJS v6 (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

## Getting started

Make sure you use NodeJS v6+. (type `node -v` to check it)

```sh
npm install -g springtunes
springtunes
```

If you want to change the server port you can use `PORT=XXXX springtunes`

By default, you should be able to access Springtunes on the host machine using [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

Then, to access it from another computer on your network, use something like http://[IP_ADDRESS_HOST_MACHINE_WITH_SPOTIFY:3000/]

## Browser extension
